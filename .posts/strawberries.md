## Selecting the Perfect Strawberry

When choosing strawberries, look for ones that are:

- Bright red
- Firm
- Have a sweet smell
- Have fresh, green leaves

Avoid strawberries that are:

- Moldy
- Soft or mushy
- Have a sour smell

## Preparing the Strawberry

Before eating a strawberry, you should:

1. Rinse it under cold water.
2. Pat it dry with a paper towel.
3. Remove the green leaves at the top (also known as the "hull").

Here's a simple Python code snippet that simulates the process:

```python
def eat_strawberry(strawberry):
    if strawberry.color == 'red' and strawberry.firmness == 'firm':
        strawberry.rinse()
        strawberry.dry()
        strawberry.remove_hull()
        print("Ready to eat!")
    else:
        print("This is not a good strawberry.")

eat_strawberry(my_strawberry)
```

You can eat a strawberry whole, or you can cut it into slices. If you're feeling fancy, you can even fan it out on a plate!
